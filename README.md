## Roles Utilities

The `roles-utils/` directory contains shared utilities that are used across multiple SV2 role implementations:

- **RPC (`rpc/`)**: Provides HTTP RPC client functionality for communicating with job declaration servers, including JSON-RPC support and transaction handling.

- **Config Helpers (`config-helpers/`)**: Utilities for parsing and managing Stratum V2 configuration files, including support for miniscript and various configuration formats.

- **Network Helpers (`network-helpers/`)**: Low-level networking utilities for SV2 roles, including connection management for both encrypted (Noise) and plain connections, as well as SV1 compatibility.

These utilities are designed to be consumed by multiple repositories in the Stratum ecosystem, providing a centralized location for common role functionality.

## Local Integration Testing

To run integration tests locally:

```bash
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh
```

This will:
1. Clone/update the integration test framework
2. Update dependencies to use your local changes
3. Run the full integration test suite
4. Restore the original configuration

## CI/CD

This repository automatically runs integration tests on every PR using the reusable workflow from the `sv2-integration-test-framework` repository.
